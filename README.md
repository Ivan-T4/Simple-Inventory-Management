# Simple-Inventory-Management
Simple Inventory Management of Manufacture Company that store their product before delivery to the customer/client

hey everyone, my name is ivan and this is my first project that i code in python.
this project is about a simple inventory management, that manufacture company use to orginize stock/product.
the reason why i choose manufacture company is because i know a little bit on how it works in inventory management and the product they usually store/keep.

the product that store using this inventory management will have a unique id. The Unique Id idea comes from a kanban system i learned with the different you probably knew, is that most company already used Barcode or QRcode,whereas i only make unique ID using combination of Name of product, the client name, the date it store, and the dimension of the product.

another reference that i tried to copy is using ABC classificiation, where you classify the product by size to store in optimal way so the room is optimized to store the product
in this project i classified products size into 3 Grades

and i think thats about it, nothing spectacular or anything for everyone, but for me, this is my commitment to learn more.
